# Learning-C
This is where I will be placing smaller projects that I build as I work towards my goal of becoming a C guru.

I will be starting this journey by going through the online course material on lynda.com. They have 6 courses with around 20 hours of lectures. After that, I will probaly move on to MIT courseware, located here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/
